/// Finds junk the Mac accumulates — leftovers of uninstalled apps, orphaned
/// startup items, caches, logs, developer build junk, the Trash — lets the
/// user review every single path with its size, and moves what they confirm
/// to the Trash. Nothing is deleted in place, nothing is touched while the
/// scan runs, and nothing runs at all until the user opens the tool.
///
/// The safety model, in order of importance:
/// 1. Review first. Every item shows its full path and size before anything
///    happens, and uncertain finds start unchecked.
/// 2. Trash, not delete. Every removal is a reversible move to the Trash
///    (the Trash category itself is the one explicit exception).
/// 3. Never guess against a living app. A leftover needs a bundle shaped
///    name whose owner is not installed, not running, not Apple, and not
///    related to any installed identifier (dot boundary family match),
///    or container metadata that names that owner. Shared wrappers and plain
///    names are never treated as proof in this general scan.
/// 4. Scoped roots only. Items come from fixed, well known junk locations.
///    The general scan never enters another app's support tree; symbolic links
///    are never followed and each item is bound to its observed file identity.
