/// the window server and escalating only when the previous stage did not make
/// the window's Space visible:
///
///  1. The window server is asked to front the exact window and the app is
///     activated cooperatively. When the app has no window on any visible
///     Space, macOS itself travels to one that has (standard system behavior),
///     and older macOS also honors the Space of the fronted window. When the
///     app does have a window here, that travel cannot happen, so this stage
///     is not waited on at all.
///  2. If the Space still is not visible, the user's own "move a space"
///     shortcut is replayed (key and modifiers read from the system, honoring
///     remaps; skipped entirely when the user disabled it), one step at a
///     time, checking after each press that the Space actually changed.
///  3. Once the window's Space is visible, Accessibility can finally see the
///     window and the regular focus pass raises it.
///
/// Waiting is done by watching the window server, never by sleeping a fixed
/// amount. The new Space is only reported once its animation finishes, so a
/// single check at a chosen moment either fires before the arrival or costs
/// more time than the switch actually took.
///
/// Every stage degrades to plain app activation, which is what happened before
/// these windows were listed at all. The object only exists for the couple of
/// seconds an activation takes and cancels itself when a newer activation
