# Creates a stable, self-signed code-signing identity named "Vorssaint Utils
# Signing" in a dedicated keychain. build.sh uses it automatically, giving every
# build the same code signature — so macOS keeps granted permissions
# (Accessibility, Screen Recording) across updates instead of re-prompting.
#
# This identity name keeps its original "Vorssaint Utils Signing" on purpose: it
# is the lookup key build.sh matches, and the released app's designated
# requirement is pinned to this exact certificate. Renaming it would change that
# requirement and drop every user's granted permissions. The name lives only in
# the keychain and codesign output, never in anything the app shows.
#
# Free, offline, and idempotent (re-running is a no-op once a working identity exists).
# It does NOT replace Apple notarization: downloaded builds still show Gatekeeper's
# "unverified developer" prompt on first launch. It only stabilizes the identity.
#
# Maintainers: official releases use the protected release-signing environment.
# Run this only to get the same permission-preserving behavior for local builds.
